Display photometric stereo reconstruct surface normal under diverse illumination patterns by using monitor. Recently, differentiable display photometric stereo (DDPS) demonstrated the improved normal reconstruction accuracy by learning display patterns. However, previous method faced several limitations, such as requiring a completely dark room and a fixed shooting setup due to the use of specialized equipment like polarization cameras and LCD monitors. In this paper, we propose differentiable mobile display photometric stereo (DMDPS) which extended DDPS by leveraging mobile devices and high-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging, enabling flexible shooting locations and eliminating the need for a dark room. We developed an app to simultaneously display and capture patterns. DMDPS learns the patterns to be displayed through this app and establishes an accurate surface normal of an object. For training supervision, the system learns patterns using a real-world 3D-printed object and a corresponding base pattern. Additionally, we have created a database of reconstructed surface normals and albedos of wild objects (fall leaves) and disclose them. When the unlearned pattern was used, the reconstruction error of 0.07394 was shown, but when the learned pattern was used, the error decreased to 0.05337. Using a mobile device (e.g., Samsung Galaxy S22) for image capture, the method allows for high-quality surface normal estimation in general settings without the restrictive conditions of a controlled environment.
